* The primary purpose of a header file is to propagate declarations to code files. They allow us to put declarations in one location and then import them wherever we need them. This can save a lot of typing in multi-file programs.

* When you #include a file, the content of the included file is inserted at the point of inclusion. This provides a useful way to pull in declarations from another file.


1. Header files should generally not contain function and variable definitions
2. Source files should #include their paired header file (if one exists).
3. Use double quotes to include header files that youâ€™ve written or are expected to be found in the current directory. Use angled brackets to include headers that come with compiler or OS.
4. When including a header file from the standard library, use the version without the .h extension if it exists. User-defined headers should still use a .h extension.
5. Use Header guards
